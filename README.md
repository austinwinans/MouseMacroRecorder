Records mouse clicks and then plays them back.

Type 'record', complete the clicks that you would like to make, and then press 'q'.

After clicks are recorded, enter 'play' and then enter the amount of times you would like to play back the clicks.

(May or may not be useful to spam Twitch channel point redeems without a cooldown)
